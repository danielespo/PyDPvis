pyDPVis is a Python tool to visualize the structure of SAT instances and runs of the DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) procedure. 

It uses networkx to display the problem's internal structure arising from its variable dependency graph. 

It can also generate animations showing dynamic change in structure during a DPLL algorithm run (wip).

Inspired by DPVIS by Carsten Sinz and Edda-Maria Dieringer.

This codebase includes a simplified DPLL in Python. Planning to add MiniSAT soon, as well as ability to visualize the search tree and clause learning.

I made this tool as an alternative to DPVis for teaching the DPLL algorithm, and for forming an intuitive sense between structure and hardness of SAT instances.
